\subsection{K-Means}

Many clustering methods exists but one of the most popular ones is called \textit{k-means} \citep{Lloyd:1982}, where k-means groups the data into \textit{k} partitions or clusters and gives insights into the general distribution in those clusters. The objective function in k-means is to minimize the squared error distance to its clusters centers. *TODO* more about k-means. 

K-means algorithm have been shown to be very useful in behavioral analysis to give good insights in the general behaviors found in a game [CITE].
