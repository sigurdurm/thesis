\section{Motivation}
We live in a time of data, where data is growing at an amazing rate. Data is everywhere around us and companies are generating more and more data.
Storing data is cheaper than ever and many smaller and mid-sized companies are buying storage subscriptions at other bigger companies that offer "Storage as a Service" (SaaS). A SaaS company offers e.g. data reliability and durability by storing critical data in multiple facilities and on multiple devices. 
Having all this data does not give a meaning by itself, it needs to be analysed and interpret to give a business value.

The need to analyse all this data have caused many new companies to rise up that are specialised in analysing large quantities of data, extracting knowledge and converting it to a business value. Many of those companies offer "Analytics as a Service" (AaaS) that offer an analytical software to discover trends and unknown patterns in the data.

\section{Problem Statement}
GameAnalytics.com is a cloud hosted service for collecting, analyzing and reporting game metrics. Working with large quantities of game metric data that needs to be analysed and processed efficiently. 

A valuable application for GA is to design and implement a scalable streaming version of a clustering algorithm. That can read a large data in mini-batches into memory and cluster the data incrementally. 

The goal would be to incrementally find clusters efficiently in a streaming data, showing predominant characteristics of human behavior, e.g. the hardcore players, casual players, people who didn't understand the game, etc.
